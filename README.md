This is the repository for paper "$\ell_{\infty}$-Bounds of the MLE in the BTL Model under General Comparison Graphs".

Two scripts:
+ *bt_mle_utils.py*: functions for MLE.
+ *simulations.py*: functions for simulations.

Notebooks:
+ *Barbell_graph.ipynb*: simulations comparing $\ell_{\infty}$ bounds for Barbell graphs.
+ *Island_graph.ipynb*: simulations comparing $\ell_{\infty}$ bounds for Island graphs.
+ *tournament_design_barbell.ipynb*, *tournament_design_island.ipynb*, *subadditivity-draw-plots.ipynb*: simulations related to tournament design.
